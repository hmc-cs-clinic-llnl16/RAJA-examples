# RAJA Proxy Applications

This repository contains three proxy applications using the RAJA programming
framework. These applications can be used as examples of how to work with RAJA in a real application.

## Building

These applications must be built as part of the RAJA project, by setting
`-DRAJA_ENABLE_APPLICATIONS=On` when configuring RAJA. Please see the main RAJA project for more details: https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA
